My instructor _insisted_ on Fril for our assigments (her focus was math so she has some interesting ideas. I got a lot of proofs in our classes). You can google it and have fun looking at the like... 3 pages of documentation for fril. The interpreter can also be downloaded from the fril website. This folder was a mess of 'I dunno what I made and what the teacher gave me'. Last touched November of 2016. I ended up keeping only what I was pretty sure I worked on.
