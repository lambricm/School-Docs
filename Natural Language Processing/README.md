# Natural Language Processing

Our main project for this class was a Semeval 2016 task. Our group had Task 6. The code above was my portion for Task A. I worked on task A practically alone. Since the semester I took this was a semester fueled by self-loathing (I took 15 credit hours and 12 of them were combined undergrad/grad classes), I did most of this in a stress-fueled 2 weekends (1 weekend for mid-term results, 1 weekend for 'improvements'). I also included the mid-term and final reports (I wrote 90% of them lol). Also had to learn LaTeX in ~45 minutes in order to turn this in on time (think I had 2 hours before the deadline). For the final, I just had to learn the LaTeX bibliography portion. Had to write most of both papers because turning it in late was an immediate 30% off and that wasn't gonna happen on _my_ watch.
