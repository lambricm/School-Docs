# Programming Languages

In this class, we took a look at the inner workings of 3 lanuages (all different types of languages):

* Java - classic OOP
* SML - Functional (AKA blow your mind languages)
* Racket - Logic (this lacked documentation on soooo many levels)

In this repo, the 3 assignment folders are all sml and the final project was in racket. I worked with 1 other team member on all of them.
