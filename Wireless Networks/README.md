Honestly, I added this class as a joke because the 'slides_per_time' excel sheet was the greatest thing I did in the class besides score higher than all but one of the 30 grad students in there on the midterm (and possibly the final).

You don't want to see the homework. The grad students didn't get it. The undergrads didn't get it. The TA didn't get it and they had the answer key.

Maybe I'll post it anyway. For the LULZ. Don't ask me how I got the answers. There were some major group chats about it just to understand the questions. And the book didn't help (neither did the slides). Both the book & the slides were written by our teacher. The slides came in text-wall why-is-this-so-white wtf-you-saying decks numbering anywhere from 30 to holy-shit-you-gotta-be-kidding-me 135 slides. That's what the excel sheet was for. I sent the graph to my friends over group chat and we'd compare the slope of each section. We were so bored.....

I had different answers & questions so whatever I guess. I posted them just because but I don't expect anyone to look at them.
